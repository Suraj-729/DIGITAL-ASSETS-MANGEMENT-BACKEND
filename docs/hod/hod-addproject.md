## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Logic (for developers)
* The endpoint validates that `projectName`, `employeeId`, and `deptName` are present in the request body.
* It constructs an object with the provided data and a `createdAt` timestamp.
* The data is then inserted as a new document into the `AssignedAssets` MongoDB collection.
* The `insertedId` from the database operation is returned to the client.
