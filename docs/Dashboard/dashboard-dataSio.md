### ‚ùå Errors

| Status Code | Message | Reason |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Logic (for developers)
* Performs a MongoDB aggregation on the `Assets` collection.
* Projects key data fields from nested objects, including `prismId`, `HOD`, `deptName`, and `projectName`.
* Uses `$unwind` on the `securityAudits` array with `preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true` to ensure projects with no audits are still included in the result.
* Sorts the final output by `expireDate` in ascending order.
